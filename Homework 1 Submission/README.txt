README:

Running our code is simple, just put the makefile and homework1-2.c in the same directory, make sure homework1-2.c is executable (change the permissions with this command: chmod 777 homework1-2.c), and type make.

You will get output like this:
Matrix size: SIZExSIZE. Iteration #x (x is simply referring to the loop variation)
total instructions = ###
total cycles = ###
l1 dca = ###
l2dca = ###

If you want to see the output of other counters, you can go into homework1-2.c and comment out the counters you don't want and uncomment the ones you do want.
